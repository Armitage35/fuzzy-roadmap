This easy to use tool will enable you to create fuzzy time roadmap in a matter of seconds.

## What is a fuzzy time roadmap?
> As a methodology, agile says: forget about planning on timelines — they’re unhelpful and hard to meet! On the other hand, roadmaps help you visualize plans, often on a timeline. So can you build an agile product roadmap? Or is this idea counterintuitive? (source: [roadmunk.com](https://roadmunk.com/guides/are-agile-product-roadmaps-counterintuitive/)).

Fuzzy time roadmaps are tools that will let your main stakeholder keep an eye on what is currently being worked on as well as to know what is next. That being said, they fully embrace development uncertainties, especially time since you do don't give any estimate or timeline. Usually, you will want to report on four basic timelines:
- In progress: what you are working on
- Soon: the next epics you will be undertaking
- Future: things that have been discussed (but you know you'll never actually work on most of the time)
- Done: items that are  completed (for now)
