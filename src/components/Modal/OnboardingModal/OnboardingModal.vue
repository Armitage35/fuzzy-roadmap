			<p>Dear product owner,</p>
			<p>You're in quite the quagmire: you want to be agile but your bosses are incraslingly asking you about "the big picture" but you don't want to get in the business of giving dates?</p>
			<p>Fuzzy time roadmap is the best middle ground you can wish for as they will give a great deal of visibility to your bosses about where the product is headed but does not includes dates. Instead of thinking in terms of dates, a fuzzy time roadmap will let your company focus on priorities.</p>
			<p> They are also an awesome tool to work with other departments since they often don't have the patience to read detailed Gantt charts or even to read your well-written Confluence pages. They simply care about what's going on now and what will happen tomorrow.</p>
			<p>With love</p>
			<p>Adrien D. A. ðŸ˜˜</p>
